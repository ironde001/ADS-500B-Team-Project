# ADS-500B Final Team Project (Group 6)
## Objective
Apply foundational analytic models to provided dataset. 
Deliverables: recorded video presentation, final .pdf document.

##Sections
### 1. Data Importing and Pre-processing
Import dataset and describe characteristics such as dimensions, data types, file types, and import methods used
Clean, wrangle, and handle missing data
Transform data appropriately using techniques such as aggregation, normalization, and feature construction
Reduce redundant data and perform need-based discretization
### 2. Data Analysis and Visualization
Identify categorical, ordinal, and numerical variables within the data
Provide measures of centrality and distribution with visualizations
Diagnose for correlations between variables and determine independent and dependent variables
Perform exploratory analysis in combination with visualization techniques to discover patterns and features of interest
### 3. Data Analytics
Determine the need for a supervised or unsupervised learning method and identify dependent and independent variables
Train, test, and provide accuracy and evaluation metrics for model results
### 4. Presentation
In a 5- to 10- minute video, briefly explain the project workflow from the code and results in your markdown notebook
State your findings from the data and provide the interpretation of results from your analysis at each stage in the project
